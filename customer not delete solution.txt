> admin customer page, when i delete the customer, it returns 'successful delete' but infact it 
does not deleted it. it still there and no info on console & network. but what i notice is, the 
email of the deleted user changes, from email to something like this 
'deleted_1761184128134_deleted_1761184105157_deleted_1761184093005_member@test.com'. inspect and 
present, NO CODING YET 

⏺ I'll investigate the customer deletion issue by examining the admin customer page
  implementation, API routes, and database operations.

⏺ Customer Deletion Bug - Analysis Report

  I've identified the root cause of the customer deletion issue. Here's the complete breakdown:

  ---
  The Problem

  When you delete a customer:
  1. ✅ API returns "successful delete" message
  2. ❌ Customer still appears in the list
  3. ❌ Email gets modified with multiple deleted_ prefixes
  4. ❌ No errors shown in console/network

  ---
  Root Cause

  This is a soft delete implementation issue with two bugs working together:

  Bug #1: DELETE endpoint performs soft delete

  Location: src/app/api/admin/customers/[customerId]/route.ts:281-288

  // Soft delete by setting status to INACTIVE
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id: params.customerId },
    data: {
      status: 'INACTIVE',
      email: `deleted_${Date.now()}_${existingCustomer.email}`, // ⚠️ PROBLEM
    },
  });

  - The record is NOT deleted from the database
  - Status is changed to INACTIVE
  - Email is prefixed with timestamp to avoid conflicts
  - Returns success message (misleading - says "deleted" but actually "deactivated")

  Bug #2: GET endpoint doesn't filter out INACTIVE users

  Location: src/app/api/admin/customers/route.ts:27-28

  const where: any = {
    role: UserRole.CUSTOMER, // ⚠️ Only filters by role, not status
  };

  - Fetches ALL customers with role=CUSTOMER
  - Includes ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED, and PENDING_VERIFICATION
  - No default exclusion of soft-deleted (INACTIVE) customers

  ---
  Why Email Gets Multiple Prefixes

  First deletion:
  Original: member@test.com
  After:    deleted_1761184093005_member@test.com

  Second deletion attempt (customer still visible):
  Reads:    deleted_1761184093005_member@test.com
  After:    deleted_1761184105157_deleted_1761184093005_member@test.com

  Third deletion attempt:
  Reads:    deleted_1761184105157_deleted_1761184093005_member@test.com
  After:    deleted_1761184128134_deleted_1761184105157_deleted_1761184093005_member@test.com

  The code at line 286 reads existingCustomer.email which already contains the prefix, then adds
  another one.

  Database Schema Confirmation

  User model (prisma/schema.prisma:10-60):
  - Has status field of type UserStatus (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED, PENDING_VERIFICATION)
  - No deletedAt timestamp field
  - Using status-based soft delete pattern

  UserStatus enum:
  enum UserStatus {
    ACTIVE
    INACTIVE
    SUSPENDED
    PENDING_VERIFICATION
  }

  ---
  Fix Options

  Option 1: Filter out INACTIVE customers from list (Quick Fix)
  - Modify GET endpoint to exclude status: 'INACTIVE' by default
  - Keep soft delete behavior
  - Users can still access INACTIVE customers via status filter if needed

  Option 2: Store original email (Better Soft Delete)
  - Add originalEmail field to track unmodified email
  - Prevent multiple prefix accumulation
  - Filter out INACTIVE from default list

  Option 3: Proper soft delete pattern (Best Practice)
  - Add deletedAt: DateTime? field to User model
  - Use timestamp-based soft delete
  - Filter where deletedAt: null in queries
  - Requires database migration

  Option 4: Hard delete (If data retention not needed)
  - Actually delete the record with prisma.user.delete()
  - Remove the soft delete logic entirely
  - Only if compliance allows permanent deletion

  ---
  Recommendation

  I recommend Option 1 (filter INACTIVE) + partial Option 2 (fix email prefix) as the quickest
  solution:

  1. Modify GET endpoint to exclude INACTIVE users by default
  2. Fix email prefix logic to prevent accumulation
  3. Consider adding a separate "Deleted Customers" view if you need to access them

  Would you like me to proceed with implementing the fix?

> is this best practice? 

⏺ No, this is not best practice. Let me explain why the current implementation is problematic:

  ---
  Problems with Current Approach

  1. Misleading "Soft Delete" Implementation

  // Current code claims "soft delete" but actually just changes status
  email: `deleted_${Date.now()}_${existingCustomer.email}`

  Issues:
  - ❌ Corrupts user data (email field now useless)
  - ❌ Can't send emails to this user anymore
  - ❌ Can't restore the user properly (email is mangled)
  - ❌ Violates data integrity - email field should contain valid emails
  - ❌ Allows multiple "deletions" (accumulating prefixes)

  2. Inconsistent Status Usage

  The status field serves dual purposes:
  - User account state (ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, PENDING_VERIFICATION)
  - Deletion flag (INACTIVE = deleted)

  This creates confusion:
  - Is INACTIVE a "deleted" user or just an "inactive" account?
  - Can a user be INACTIVE but not deleted?
  - What if you want to suspend vs delete?

  3. No Audit Trail

  - No deletedAt timestamp
  - No deletedBy tracking
  - Can't tell WHEN or WHO deleted the customer
  - Can't distinguish between never-activated and soft-deleted

  4. Filtering Complexity

  Every query must remember to exclude INACTIVE:
  // You'll need this everywhere
  where: {
    role: UserRole.CUSTOMER,
    status: { not: 'INACTIVE' } // Easy to forget
  }

  Best Practice: Industry Standard Soft Delete

  Approach 1: Timestamp-Based (Most Common)

  Add to schema:
  model User {
    // ... existing fields
    deletedAt DateTime? // NULL = active, NOT NULL = deleted
    deletedBy String?   // Who deleted it (admin user ID)

    @@index([deletedAt]) // For fast filtering
  }

  Benefits:
  - ✅ Clear deletion state (deletedAt != null)
  - ✅ Preserves original data completely
  - ✅ Audit trail (when deleted)
  - ✅ Can restore users easily
  - ✅ Simple queries: where: { deletedAt: null }

  Usage:
  // Delete
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id },
    data: {
      deletedAt: new Date(),
      deletedBy: session.user.id
    }
  });

  // Query active users
  await prisma.user.findMany({
    where: { deletedAt: null }
  });

  // Include deleted (admin view)
  await prisma.user.findMany({
    where: {} // No filter = all
  });

  // Restore
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id },
    data: { deletedAt: null, deletedBy: null }
  });

  ---
  Approach 2: Separate Deleted Users Table (High Compliance)

  For stricter data governance:

  model User {
    // Active users only
  }

  model DeletedUser {
    // Same structure as User
    originalId    String
    deletedAt     DateTime
    deletedBy     String
    deletionReason String?
  }

  Benefits:
  - ✅ Complete separation
  - ✅ Can apply different access controls
  - ✅ Easier to purge old deleted records
  - ✅ Clear "users" table only has active users

  ---
  Approach 3: Status + Metadata (Hybrid)

  Keep status but add proper deletion tracking:

  model User {
    status      UserStatus
    deletedAt   DateTime?
    deletedBy   String?

    // status can be ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, etc.
    // deletedAt indicates soft delete
  }

  Query:
  where: {
    deletedAt: null,  // Not deleted
    status: 'ACTIVE'  // And active
  }

  Comparison Table

  | Aspect           | Current Implementation         | Best Practice (deletedAt)    |
  |------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
  | Data Integrity   | ❌ Corrupts email               | ✅ Preserves all data         |
  | Reversible       | ❌ Email is mangled             | ✅ Fully reversible           |
  | Audit Trail      | ❌ No timestamp/actor           | ✅ Complete audit info        |
  | Query Clarity    | ❌ Confusing status use         | ✅ Clear deletedAt: null      |
  | Multiple Deletes | ❌ Accumulates prefixes         | ✅ Idempotent                 |
  | Email Conflicts  | ❌ Hacky prefix solution        | ✅ No need to modify email    |
  | Restoration      | ❌ Can't restore original email | ✅ Simply set deletedAt: null |

  ---
  My Recommendation

  Implement Approach 1 (deletedAt timestamp) because:

  1. Industry standard - Used by Rails, Django, Laravel frameworks
  2. Simple to implement - Just one migration
  3. Preserves data integrity - Email stays valid
  4. Enables restoration - Can undo deletions
  5. Clear audit trail - Know when/who deleted
  6. GDPR/compliance friendly - Can find all deleted users for data retention policies

  ---
  Migration Path

  If you want to fix this properly:

  1. Add deletedAt and deletedBy fields to User model
  2. Run migration to add columns
  3. Update existing "deleted" users (those with deleted_ prefix in email)
  4. Change DELETE endpoint to use deletedAt
  5. Add global filter for deletedAt: null or use Prisma middleware
  6. Optional: Create "Deleted Customers" admin view

  ---
  Would you like me to implement the proper soft delete pattern with deletedAt? This would be a
  more robust, maintainable solution that follows industry best practices.
