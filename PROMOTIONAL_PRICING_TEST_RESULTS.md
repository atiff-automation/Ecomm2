   - ‚úÖ Scheduled promotions show correct pricing (regular) and display text
   - ‚úÖ Active promotions apply promotional pricing correctly  
   - ‚úÖ Expired promotions revert to member/regular pricing
   - ‚úÖ Date calculations and display text generation work correctly

   - ‚úÖ Member price applies when no active promotion
   - ‚úÖ Regular price applies for non-members without promotions
   - ‚úÖ Savings calculations work correctly for all price types

3. **Membership Qualification Override** 
   - ‚úÖ Active promotional products do NOT qualify for membership threshold
   - ‚úÖ Scheduled promotional products DO qualify for membership threshold
   - ‚úÖ Expired promotional products DO qualify for membership threshold
   - ‚úÖ Regular products qualify normally based on isQualifyingForMembership flag

4. **User Experience Logic**
   - ‚úÖ Members and non-members get same promotional price during active promotions
   - ‚úÖ Display text shows appropriate urgency messages ("Ends in X days")

2. **Price Display Hierarchy**
   ```
   Active Promotional Price > Member Price > Regular Price
   ```

3. **Membership Qualification Rules**
   ```
   Active Promotion = FALSE (override)
   Non-Active Promotion = Based on isQualifyingForMembership flag
   ```
