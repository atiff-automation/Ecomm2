> please inspect and present the issue. i does not received any telegram notification for new 
order and low stock notification. when i test in the notification page, it do sents the testing to
 my telegram, but when there is new order or low stock no notification received. please inspect, 
no code yet 

⏺ I'll inspect the notification system to identify why Telegram notifications aren't being sent
  for new orders and low stock despite the test working. Let me investigate systematically.

⏺ Let me investigate the notification system files:

⏺ Read(src/app/api/admin/settings/notifications/route.ts)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Search(pattern: "sendTelegramNotification")
  ⎿  Found 0 files

⏺ Now let me check where low stock alerts should be triggered from product updates:

⏺ Search(pattern: "(sendLowStockAlert|lowStockAlert|low.*stock)", type: "ts")
  ⎿  Found 36 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Read(src/lib/services/enhanced-product-service.ts)

⏺ Now let me check the webhook flow more carefully:

⏺ Bash(grep -rn "sendLowStockAlert" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" src/) timeout: 10m 0s
  ⎿ src//app/api/admin/telegram/simple-test-inventory/route.ts:50:    const success = await simpl

    … +5 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ Perfect! Now I have identified the issues. Let me complete the analysis:

⏺ Root Cause Analysis: Telegram Notifications Not Sending

  I've completed my investigation and identified two critical issues preventing Telegram
  notifications from being sent for new orders and low stock alerts.

  ---
  Issue #1: New Order Notifications - Missing Webhook Call 🔴

  The Problem

  The toyyibPay webhook (src/app/api/webhooks/toyyibpay/route.ts) does NOT call the
  OrderStatusHandler.handleOrderStatusChange() method that triggers Telegram notifications.

  Evidence

  Line 283-296 in toyyibpay/route.ts:
  // Update order status directly without triggering notifications
  // Notifications are handled by the centralized payment-success webhook to avoid duplicates
  await prisma.order.update({
    where: { id: order.id },
    data: {
      status: newOrderStatus,
      paymentStatus: newPaymentStatus,
      paymentId: callback.refno,
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    },
  });

  The comment says notifications are handled by the "centralized payment-success webhook" but the
  toyyibPay webhook never calls that webhook. It directly updates the database and skips
  notification logic entirely.

  Compare with payment-success webhook

  Lines 199-214 in payment-success/route.ts:
  await OrderStatusHandler.handleOrderStatusChange({
    orderId: order.id,
    previousStatus,
    newStatus: 'PAID',
    previousPaymentStatus,
    newPaymentStatus: 'PAID',
    triggeredBy: 'webhook_payment_gateway',
    metadata: {
      transactionId,
      webhookTimestamp: timestamp,
    },
  });

  What Actually Sends Notifications

  Lines 116-141 in order-status-handler.ts:
  private static async handlePaymentSuccess(order: any, data: OrderStatusChangeData) {
    console.log('💰 Payment success detected for order:', order.orderNumber);

    // Send Telegram notification for successful payment
    await simplifiedTelegramService.sendNewOrderNotification({
      orderNumber: order.orderNumber,
      customerName,
      total: Number(order.total),
      items: order.orderItems.map(...),
      paymentMethod: ...,
      createdAt: new Date(),
    });
  }

  Root Cause

  toyyibPay webhook (route.ts:283-296) → Updates DB directly → NO notification call → NO Telegram
  message sent

  ---
  Issue #2: Low Stock Alerts - Never Implemented 🔴

  The Problem

  The sendLowStockAlert() function exists in the Telegram service but is NEVER CALLED anywhere in
  the codebase except in test routes.

  Evidence

  Search results show only 2 real usages:
  1. Definition: src/lib/telegram/simplified-telegram-service.ts:538 - the function itself
  2. Test Only: src/app/api/admin/telegram/simple-test-inventory/route.ts:50 - test endpoint

  Where It SHOULD Be Called

  When products are updated with low stock, the code at
  src/app/api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts:244-368 updates stock quantities BUT never checks if
  stock fell below lowStockAlert threshold and never calls sendLowStockAlert().

  What's Missing

  After updating product stock (line 269-273):
  ...(productData.stockQuantity !== undefined && {
    stockQuantity: productData.stockQuantity,
  }),

  There should be logic like:
  // Check if stock dropped below alert threshold
  if (productData.stockQuantity <= existingProduct.lowStockAlert) {
    await simplifiedTelegramService.sendLowStockAlert(
      updatedProduct.name,
      productData.stockQuantity,
      updatedProduct.sku
    );
  }

  But this does not exist anywhere in the product update route.

  -----|-------------------------------------------|
  | New Order Notifications | src/app/api/webhooks/toyyibpay/route.ts:283-296 | 🔴 Missing 
  Integration | No Telegram notifications for paid orders |
  | Low Stock Alerts        | src/app/api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts        | 🔴 Not Implemented
       | Low stock detection logic never runs      |

  Why Test Works

  The test endpoints (simple-test-order/route.ts, simple-test-inventory/route.ts) directly call
  the Telegram service methods, bypassing the broken production flow. That's why testing works but
   real orders/stock updates don't trigger notifications.

⏺ ---
  Next Steps

  Would you like me to:

  1. Fix the new order notification issue by adding OrderStatusHandler.handleOrderStatusChange()
  to the toyyibPay webhook?
  2. Implement low stock alerts by adding stock monitoring logic to the product update route?
  3. Both fixes together?

  Let me know and I'll implement the solution!

⏺ You're absolutely right! The comment in the code says it was intentionally designed this way.
  Let me check if there's actually a separate webhook or mechanism that should be triggering
  notifications:

⏺ Perfect! You're absolutely correct - it WAS working before! The old version used:

  await updateOrderStatus(order.id, newOrderStatus, newPaymentStatus, 'toyyibpay-webhook', {...});

  But the current version removed that call and replaced it with direct database update. Let me
  see when/why this was changed:

⏺ Bash(git diff 1b5f8bc..8a75245 -- src/app/api/webhooks/toyyibpay/route.ts | grep -B5  timeout: 10m

          }
     … +34 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Updated Root Cause Analysis

  You're 100% correct! The notifications DID work before, but they were accidentally broken in
  commit 8a75245 (Oct 10, 2025).

  What Happened:

  BEFORE (Working):
  // Old version at commit 1b5f8bc
  await updateOrderStatus(
    order.id,
    newOrderStatus,
    newPaymentStatus,
    'toyyibpay-webhook',
    {...}
  );
  // ✅ This called OrderStatusHandler.handleOrderStatusChange()
  // ✅ Which triggered Telegram notifications

  AFTER (Broken):
  // Current version after commit 8a75245
  // Update order status directly without triggering notifications
  // Notifications are handled by the centralized payment-success webhook to avoid duplicates
  await prisma.order.update({
    where: { id: order.id },
    data: {
      status: newOrderStatus,
      paymentStatus: newPaymentStatus,
      paymentId: callback.refno,
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    },
  });
  // ❌ updateOrderStatus() removed → No notification handler called
  // ❌ Comment says "centralized payment-success webhook" handles it
  // ❌ BUT payment-success webhook is NEVER called!

  The Bug:

  The comment says "Notifications are handled by the centralized payment-success webhook to avoid 
  duplicates" but:
  1. The toyyibPay webhook doesn't call the payment-success webhook
  2. toyyibPay handles its own payment processing
  3. The notification call was removed but never replaced

  Result:

  Notifications stopped working after Oct 10, 2025 when commit 8a75245 removed the
  updateOrderStatus() call.

  ---
  For Low Stock Alerts:

  My original finding still stands - low stock alerts were never implemented in the product update
   flow. The function exists but is never called when stock changes.

  ---
  Would you like me to restore the working notification flow?

> do not restore, plan to correct it. for order stock, we need it handle by centralized 
payment-success webhook to avoid duplicate, for low stock do what is the best. present to me first

  Solution 1: New Order Notifications (Centralized Approach)

  Current Architecture Problem

  ┌─────────────────┐
  │  ToyyibPay      │
  │  Webhook        │──┐
  └─────────────────┘  │
                       │  ❌ Both webhooks handle payment
  ┌─────────────────┐  │     separately → No coordination
  │  Payment-Success│  │
  │  Webhook        │──┘
  └─────────────────┘

  Proposed Solution: Make toyyibPay call OrderStatusHandler

  Why this approach:
  - ToyyibPay webhook is the REAL payment processor (used in production)
  - Payment-success webhook appears to be for testing/simulation only
  - Centralized approach = notifications should happen where REAL payment processing happens

  Implementation Strategy

  File: src/app/api/webhooks/toyyibpay/route.ts

  Changes Required:

  Step 1: Import OrderStatusHandler

  // ADD this import at top
  import { OrderStatusHandler } from '@/lib/notifications/order-status-handler';

  Step 2: Replace Direct DB Update with Handler Call

  Current (Broken):
  // Lines 283-296 - REMOVE THIS
  await prisma.order.update({
    where: { id: order.id },
    data: {
      status: newOrderStatus,
      paymentStatus: newPaymentStatus,
      paymentId: callback.refno,
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    },
  });

  New (Working):
  // Get current status BEFORE update for change tracking
  const previousStatus = order.status;
  const previousPaymentStatus = order.paymentStatus;

  // Update database
  await prisma.order.update({
    where: { id: order.id },
    data: {
      status: newOrderStatus,
      paymentStatus: newPaymentStatus,
      paymentId: callback.refno,
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    },
  });

  // ✅ TRIGGER NOTIFICATIONS via centralized handler
  if (newPaymentStatus === 'PAID' && previousPaymentStatus !== 'PAID') {
    try {
      await OrderStatusHandler.handleOrderStatusChange({
        orderId: order.id,
        previousStatus,
        newStatus: newOrderStatus,
        previousPaymentStatus,
        newPaymentStatus,
        triggeredBy: 'toyyibpay-webhook',
        metadata: {
          billCode: callback.billcode,
          refNo: callback.refno,
          paymentAmount: callback.amount,
          transactionTime: callback.transaction_time,
        },
      });

      console.log('✅ Order status change handled for order:', order.orderNumber);
    } catch (notificationError) {
      // Don't fail webhook if notification fails
      console.error('❌ Failed to handle order status change:', notificationError);
    }
  }

  Benefits:

  ✅ Follows existing pattern (payment-success webhook already uses this)✅ Centralized
  notification logic via OrderStatusHandler✅ No duplicate notifications (only fires when payment
  status changes to PAID)✅ Non-blocking (webhook succeeds even if notification fails)✅ Proper
  audit trail via OrderStatusHandler

  ---
  Solution 2: Low Stock Alerts

  Proposed Solution: Product Update Hook + Background Check

  Two approaches to consider:

  Option A: Real-Time Detection (Recommended)

  Trigger low stock alert immediately when stock drops below threshold during product updates.

  File: src/app/api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts

  Location: After product update transaction (line 368)

  Implementation:
  // After the transaction completes (line 368)
  const result = await prisma.$transaction(async tx => {
    // ... existing product update code ...
    return updatedProduct;
  });

  // ✅ CHECK FOR LOW STOCK after successful update
  if (
    productData.stockQuantity !== undefined &&
    result.lowStockAlert > 0 && // Only if alert threshold is set
    productData.stockQuantity <= result.lowStockAlert
  ) {
    try {
      await simplifiedTelegramService.sendLowStockAlert(
        result.name,
        productData.stockQuantity,
        result.sku
      );

      console.log(`⚠️ Low stock alert sent for ${result.name}: ${productData.stockQuantity} <= 
  ${result.lowStockAlert}`);
    } catch (notificationError) {
      console.error('❌ Failed to send low stock alert:', notificationError);
      // Don't fail the product update if notification fails
    }
  }

  Triggers:
  - ✅ Admin manually updates stock via product edit
  - ✅ Product import updates stock quantities
  - ❌ Order purchase deducts stock (handled in Option B below)

  Option B: Order-Triggered Stock Alerts

  Detect low stock after order stock deduction (when customers buy products).

  File: src/app/api/webhooks/toyyibpay/route.ts

  Location: After stock restoration logic (line 275)

  Implementation:
  if (callback.status === '1') {
    // Success - payment confirmed
    newPaymentStatus = 'PAID';
    newOrderStatus = 'PAID';

    // ✅ CHECK FOR LOW STOCK after order confirmed
    // Stock was already deducted during order creation
    for (const item of order.orderItems) {
      const product = await prisma.product.findUnique({
        where: { id: item.productId },
        select: {
          stockQuantity: true,
          lowStockAlert: true,
          name: true,
          sku: true
        }
      });

      if (product && product.lowStockAlert > 0) {
        // Check if stock dropped below threshold
        if (product.stockQuantity <= product.lowStockAlert) {
          try {
            await simplifiedTelegramService.sendLowStockAlert(
              product.name,
              product.stockQuantity,
              product.sku
            );

            console.log(`⚠️ Low stock alert: ${product.name} (${product.stockQuantity} units 
  remaining)`);
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('❌ Failed to send low stock alert:', error);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  Triggers:
  - ✅ Customer completes purchase
  - ✅ Detects low stock across all items in order
  - ✅ Sends alert for each product below threshold

  ---
  Recommended Implementation Plan

  Implement BOTH Options:

  1. Option A - Catches manual stock updates by admin
  2. Option B - Catches stock depletion from customer orders

  This ensures complete coverage for all stock change scenarios.

  Risk Assessment

  | Change                                      | Risk Level | Mitigation
             |
  |---------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------
  -----------|
  | Add OrderStatusHandler to toyyibPay webhook | 🟡 Medium  | Wrapped in try-catch, won't fail
  webhook      |
  | Low stock alerts in product update          | 🟢 Low     | Non-blocking, runs after successful
   update    |
  | Low stock alerts in order webhook           | 🟡 Medium  | May increase webhook processing
  time slightly |

  ---
  Testing Plan

  After Implementation:

  Test 1: New Order Notifications
  1. Create test order via checkout
  2. Process payment via toyyibPay
  3. Verify Telegram notification received with order details

  Test 2: Low Stock - Manual Update
  1. Edit product, set stock to 5, lowStockAlert to 10
  2. Save product
  3. Verify Telegram alert received

  Test 3: Low Stock - Order Purchase
  1. Create product with stock=12, lowStockAlert=10
  2. Customer orders 3 units (stock becomes 9)
  3. Complete payment
  4. Verify Telegram alert received

  Test 4: No Duplicate Notifications
  1. Process multiple toyyibPay callbacks for same order
  2. Verify only ONE notification sent (status change detection works)

  Questions for You:

  1. New Order Notifications: Do you approve the approach of adding OrderStatusHandler to the
  toyyibPay webhook?
  2. Low Stock Alerts: Which option do you prefer?
    - Option A only (admin manual updates)
    - Option B only (customer order depletion)
    - Both A + B (comprehensive coverage) ✅ Recommended
  3. Alert Frequency: Should we add deduplication logic to prevent spam if stock stays low?
    - Example: Only alert once when stock first drops below threshold, not on every update while
  still low
  4. Additional Scenarios: Any other stock change scenarios I should consider?
    - Product imports
    - Bulk stock updates
    - Stock restocking (should we notify when stock is replenished above threshold?)

  Let me know your preferences and I'll implement accordingly!

> question on New Order Notifications: what if we have another payment gateway too like billplz, 
do we need to create the webhook success for billplz success payment? the purpose of centralised 
is to make it also general for any payment gateway success situation. do you go me? am i answering
 our concern? 

⏺ Absolutely brilliant catch! 🎯 You're 100% right - I misunderstood the architecture!

  Let me re-analyze:

⏺ Search(pattern: "billplz", path: "src/app/api")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Bash(find src/app/api/webhooks -type f -name "*.ts" | head -10) timeout: 10m 0s
  ⎿  src/app/api/webhooks/easyparcel-tracking/route.ts
     src/app/api/webhooks/payment-success/route.ts
     src/app/api/webhooks/payment-failed/route.ts
     src/app/api/webhooks/toyyibpay/route.ts

⏺ Perfect! Now I understand the architecture. Let me check how the payment-success webhook is
  supposed to be called:

⏺ Bash(grep -rn "payment-success\|payment-failed" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"      timeout: 10m 
      src/app/api/payment src/app/api/webhooks/toyyibpay | head -20)                      0s
  ⎿ src/app/api/webhooks/toyyibpay/route.ts:284:    // Notifications are handled by the centraliz
    ed payment-success webhook to avoid duplicates


⏺ Read(src/app/api/webhooks/payment-failed/route.ts)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

⏺ Now I understand! You're asking: Should toyyibPay webhook CALL the centralized payment-success 
  webhook internally? Let me investigate the correct pattern:

⏺ 🎯 YES! You're Exactly Right!

  The Problem

  Current toyyibPay webhook does:
  - ❌ Updates database directly
  - ❌ Handles membership logic itself
  - ❌ Does NOT call payment-success webhook
  - ❌ Comment says it should call centralized webhook, but doesn't!

  It SHOULD do:
  - ✅ Update database with payment details
  - ✅ CALL /api/webhooks/payment-success internally
  - ✅ Let centralized webhook handle notifications + business logic

  ---
  ✅ CORRECTED Solution: Internal Webhook Call Pattern

⏺ Implementation in toyyibPay Webhook

  File: src/app/api/webhooks/toyyibpay/route.ts

  After database update (replace lines 283-296):

  // Update order status in database
  await prisma.order.update({
    where: { id: order.id },
    data: {
      status: newOrderStatus,
      paymentStatus: newPaymentStatus,
      paymentId: callback.refno,
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    },
  });

  console.log(`✅ Order ${order.orderNumber} updated: ${newOrderStatus}/${newPaymentStatus}`);

  // ✅ CALL CENTRALIZED WEBHOOK for payment success
  // This triggers notifications, membership activation, and all business logic
  if (callback.status === '1') { // Payment successful
    try {
      // Make internal HTTP call to centralized payment-success webhook
      const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
      const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/webhooks/payment-success`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          // Add internal auth header to verify this is internal call
          'X-Internal-Webhook': process.env.WEBHOOK_INTERNAL_SECRET || 'internal',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          orderReference: order.orderNumber,
          amount: parseFloat(callback.amount) / 100, // Convert cents to dollars
          currency: 'MYR',
          status: 'PAID',
          transactionId: callback.refno,
          timestamp: callback.transaction_time || new Date().toISOString(),
          source: 'toyyibpay', // Identify the payment gateway
        }),
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        const error = await response.text();
        console.error('❌ Failed to trigger centralized webhook:', error);
      } else {
        console.log('✅ Centralized payment-success webhook called successfully');
      }
    } catch (webhookError) {
      console.error('❌ Error calling centralized webhook:', webhookError);
      // Don't fail the toyyibPay webhook if internal call fails
    }
  }

  Benefits of This Approach:

  ✅ Gateway-Agnostic: Add Billplz, Stripe, etc. - all call same centralized webhook✅ Single 
  Source of Truth: All payment success logic in ONE place✅ No Code Duplication: Don't repeat
  notification logic in every gateway webhook✅ Easy Testing: Can test payment-success webhook
  independently✅ Maintainability: Change notification logic once, affects all gateways

  ---
  Alternative Approach: Shared Service Layer

  If you don't want HTTP calls between webhooks:

  Create a shared service that both webhooks call:

  // src/lib/services/payment-success-handler.service.ts

  export class PaymentSuccessHandler {
    static async handlePaymentSuccess(orderReference: string, metadata: {
      amount: number;
      transactionId: string;
      paymentGateway: string;
      timestamp: string;
    }) {
      // Find order
      const order = await prisma.order.findFirst({
        where: { orderNumber: orderReference },
        include: { /* ... */ }
      });

      if (!order) return { success: false, error: 'Order not found' };

      // Trigger all business logic
      await OrderStatusHandler.handleOrderStatusChange({
        orderId: order.id,
        previousStatus: order.status,
        newStatus: 'PAID',
        /* ... */
      });

      await MembershipService.processOrderForMembership(order.id);

      // etc...

      return { success: true };
    }
  }

  Then both toyyibPay webhook and payment-success webhook call this service.

  ---
  Which Approach Do You Prefer?

  Option 1: ToyyibPay webhook → Internal HTTP call → payment-success webhookOption 2: ToyyibPay
  webhook → Shared Service → Business logic

  Both achieve centralization. Option 1 reuses existing payment-success webhook. Option 2 avoids
  HTTP overhead.
