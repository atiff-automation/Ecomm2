## üöÄ Railway Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Railway Project
```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Create new project
railway init
```

### Step 2: Add Required Services

#### PostgreSQL Database
```bash
# Add PostgreSQL plugin
railway add postgresql
```

#### Redis Cache
```bash
# Add Redis plugin
railway add redis
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Set these variables in Railway dashboard or CLI:

#### Core Application
```bash
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret-here"
railway variables set NEXTAUTH_URL="${{RAILWAY_STATIC_URL}}"
```

#### Database (Auto-configured by Railway)
```bash
# DATABASE_URL - automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL
# REDIS_URL - automatically set by Railway Redis
```

#### Business Configuration
```bash
railway variables set BUSINESS_NAME="EcomJRM Store"
railway variables set BUSINESS_EMAIL="store@ecomjrm.com"
railway variables set BUSINESS_PHONE="+60123456789"
railway variables set DEFAULT_CURRENCY="MYR"
railway variables set MEMBERSHIP_THRESHOLD="80.00"
```

#### Telegram Notifications (Optional)
```bash
railway variables set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-telegram-bot-token"
railway variables set TELEGRAM_ORDERS_CHAT_ID="your-orders-chat-id"
railway variables set TELEGRAM_INVENTORY_CHAT_ID="your-inventory-chat-id"
```

#### Security Keys
```bash
# Generate secure keys for production
railway variables set ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
railway variables set TELEGRAM_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

#### Email Configuration (Configure based on your provider)
```bash
railway variables set EMAIL_FROM="noreply@yourdomain.com"
railway variables set EMAIL_SERVER_HOST="smtp.your-provider.com"
railway variables set EMAIL_SERVER_PORT="587"
railway variables set EMAIL_SERVER_USER="your-smtp-user"
railway variables set EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD="your-smtp-password"
```

### Step 4: Deploy Application
```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway up
```

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Setup

#### Run Database Migrations
```bash
# Connect to Railway project
railway shell

# Run the deployment script
chmod +x scripts/railway-deploy.sh
./scripts/railway-deploy.sh
```

Or manually run:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run db:seed:production
```

## üîß Configuration Details

### Railway Service Configuration

#### Build Settings
- **Builder**: Nixpacks (automatic detection)
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Health Check**: `GET /` (200 OK)
- **Memory**: 512MB (Railway hobby limit)
- **Timeout**: 300 seconds

#### Port Configuration
- **Application Port**: 3000 (default Next.js)
- **Health Check**: Railway automatically detects

### Database Schema
The application includes:
- User management with Malaysian membership system
- Product catalog with categories
- Order processing with Malaysian shipping integration
- Admin dashboard with analytics
- Telegram notifications
- Chat system
- Malaysian postcode data (40,000+ entries)

### File Storage
- **Upload Directory**: `/uploads` (Railway filesystem)
- **Allowed Types**: Images (JPEG, PNG, WebP), PDFs
- **Max Size**: 10MB per file
- **Persistence**: Files persist across deployments

---

## üìä Expected Resource Usage

### Railway Hobby Package Limits:
- **Memory**: 512MB (should be sufficient)
- **CPU**: Shared vCPU (adequate for low-medium traffic)
- **Network**: 100GB/month outbound
- **Build Time**: ~3-5 minutes
- **Cold Start**: ~10-15 seconds

### Performance Optimizations Applied:
- Standalone Next.js output (smaller container)
- Production build optimizations
- Prisma connection pooling
- Redis caching for sessions
- Image optimization enabled
- Webpack bundle splitting

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### Build Timeouts
```bash
# If build times out, try building locally first
npm run build
# Then deploy pre-built
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database URL
railway variables
# Verify Prisma connection
railway shell
npx prisma db pull
```

#### Memory Issues
```bash
# Monitor memory usage
railway logs
# Optimize if needed by reducing concurrent operations
```

#### Environment Variables Not Loading
```bash
# List all variables
railway variables
# Check for typos or missing values
```

### Debugging Commands:
```bash
# View application logs
railway logs

# Connect to database
railway connect postgresql

# Run database queries
railway shell
npx prisma studio --port 5555
```

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### Deploying Updates:
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Deploy to Railway
railway up
```

### Database Migrations:
```bash
# For schema changes
railway shell
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Monitoring:
- **Railway Dashboard**: Monitor resource usage, logs, deployments
- **Application Logs**: View in Railway logs or application admin panel
- **Database**: Use Prisma Studio for database management
