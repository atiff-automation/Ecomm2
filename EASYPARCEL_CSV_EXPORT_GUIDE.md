}

// Set API mode  
POST /api/admin/shipping/mode
{
  "mode": "api",
  "reason": "API restored"
}
```

## üìù Usage Workflow

### 1. Filter and Select Orders
```typescript
// Recommended filters for shipping
{
  "status": ["CONFIRMED", "PROCESSING"],
  "paymentStatus": ["PAID"],
  "dateFrom": "2025-08-01",
  "dateTo": "2025-08-31"
}
```

### 2. Preview Before Export
- Review order count and estimated file size
- Check validation warnings
- Verify customer information completeness
- Confirm parcel details accuracy

### 3. Export and Upload
- Download CSV file with timestamp
- Log into EasyParcel website
- Use their bulk upload feature
- Upload the CSV file
- Process shipments through their interface

### 4. Track and Monitor
- Note tracking numbers from EasyParcel
- Update order status in your system
- Monitor delivery progress

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Data Requirements
- **Business profile must be configured** - Required for sender information
- **Complete shipping addresses** - All customer addresses must be complete
- **Valid phone numbers** - Malaysian format required (+60XXXXXXXXX)
- **Accurate weights** - Products should have weight information
- **Postal codes** - Must be valid 5-digit Malaysian postal codes

### Limitations
- **Manual process** - Requires manual upload to EasyParcel
- **No real-time tracking** - Tracking updates not automatic
- **Batch processing** - Best for bulk operations
- **No rate calculation** - Uses business default settings

### Best Practices
- **Export in batches** - Limit to 100-500 orders per export
- **Validate before upload** - Always preview and check for errors
- **Keep records** - Save CSV files for reference
- **Regular exports** - Don't let orders accumulate

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Business profile not configured"**
   - Solution: Complete business configuration in Admin ‚Üí Shipping ‚Üí Business Config

2. **"Invalid phone number format"**
   - Solution: Ensure phone numbers are in Malaysian format (+60XXXXXXXXX)

3. **"Shipping address incomplete"**
   - Solution: Check orders have complete shipping addresses

4. **"Parcel weight missing"**
   - Solution: Update product weights in catalog

5. **"Invalid postal code"**
   - Solution: Verify 5-digit Malaysian postal codes

### Validation Errors

The system provides detailed validation reports:
- **Critical errors** - Must be fixed before export
- **Warnings** - Should be reviewed but not blocking
- **Success rate** - Percentage of orders that will process successfully

### Export Failures

If CSV export fails:
1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify business profile configuration
3. Reduce export batch size
4. Check database connectivity
5. Contact system administrator
