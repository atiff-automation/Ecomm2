# Production Payment Integration Strategy
## JRM E-commerce Platform - Malaysian Market

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the production deployment strategy for payment integration in the JRM e-commerce platform, specifically tailored for the Malaysian market. The platform currently uses a test payment simulator and is ready for Billplz integration.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Components
- **Payment-first membership activation logic** - Users only receive membership benefits after successful payment
- **Pending membership system** - Tracks membership registrations awaiting payment confirmation
- **Webhook-based activation** - Real-time membership activation upon payment success
- **Comprehensive testing infrastructure** - Payment simulator and testing dashboard
- **Order management system** - Complete order lifecycle with payment status tracking
- **Guest checkout support** - Non-authenticated users can complete purchases

### ðŸ”„ Production Requirements
- Replace test payment simulator with Billplz API integration
- Configure production webhook endpoints
- Setup Billplz merchant account and credentials
- Implement production monitoring and error handling

---

## Recommended Payment Gateway: Billplz

### Why Billplz?
1. **Malaysian-focused** - Built specifically for Malaysian businesses
2. **Local payment methods** - FPX, credit/debit cards, e-wallets
3. **Competitive pricing** - 2.5% transaction fee (industry standard)
4. **Developer-friendly** - Well-documented API and webhooks
5. **Regulatory compliance** - Meets Malaysian financial regulations

### Alternative Considerations
- **Stripe** - Higher international fees, limited local payment methods
- **iPay88** - More complex integration, higher setup costs
- **eGHL** - Enterprise-focused, extensive approval process

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Production Setup (1-2 weeks)

#### 1.1 Merchant Account Setup
```bash
# Billplz Account Requirements
- Business registration documents
- Bank account verification
- Identity verification (IC/Passport)
- Business address verification
```

#### 1.2 Development Environment
```bash
# Environment Variables (Development)
BILLPLZ_API_KEY=your_sandbox_api_key
BILLPLZ_X_SIGNATURE=your_sandbox_x_signature
BILLPLZ_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/payment/webhook
BILLPLZ_SANDBOX=true
```

#### 1.3 API Integration Points
1. **Order Creation** â†’ Create Billplz bill
2. **Payment Success** â†’ Webhook processes membership activation
3. **Payment Failure** â†’ Order cancellation and cleanup
4. **Refunds** â†’ Billplz refund API (if needed)

### Phase 2: Code Implementation (1 week)

#### 2.1 Replace Test Simulator
Current file: `/src/app/api/payment/test-simulator/route.ts`
Replace with: `/src/app/api/payment/billplz/create-bill/route.ts`

```typescript
// Example Billplz Integration
import { Billplz } from '@billplz/billplz-node';

const billplz = new Billplz({
  apiKey: process.env.BILLPLZ_API_KEY,
  xSignature: process.env.BILLPLZ_X_SIGNATURE,
  sandbox: process.env.BILLPLZ_SANDBOX === 'true'
});

// Create bill for order
const bill = await billplz.bill.create({
  collection_id: process.env.BILLPLZ_COLLECTION_ID,
  description: `Order ${order.orderNumber}`,
  email: order.user.email,
  name: `${order.user.firstName} ${order.user.lastName}`,
  amount: Math.round(order.total * 100), // Convert to cents
  callback_url: `${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL}/api/payment/webhook`,
  redirect_url: `${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL}/order/confirmation/${order.id}`
});
```

#### 2.2 Webhook Verification
Current webhook at: `/src/app/api/payment/webhook/route.ts`
Needs: Billplz signature verification

```typescript
// Verify Billplz webhook signature
const verifyBillplzSignature = (signature: string, data: string) => {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', process.env.BILLPLZ_X_SIGNATURE!)
    .update(data)
    .digest('hex');
  
  return signature === expectedSignature;
};
```

#### 2.3 Error Handling
- Network failures â†’ Retry mechanism
- Invalid signatures â†’ Security logging
- Failed payments â†’ User notification
- Webhook failures â†’ Admin alerts

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (1 week)

#### 3.2 Load Testing

- Database transaction integrity
- Session management during payment

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (1 week)

#### 4.1 Production Environment Variables
```bash
# Production Environment
BILLPLZ_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
BILLPLZ_X_SIGNATURE=your_production_x_signature
BILLPLZ_WEBHOOK_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api/payment/webhook
BILLPLZ_SANDBOX=false
BILLPLZ_COLLECTION_ID=your_collection_id
```

3. IP whitelisting (Billplz IPs)
4. Rate limiting on webhook endpoints
5. Audit logging for all payment events
```

### 4.2 Data Protection
