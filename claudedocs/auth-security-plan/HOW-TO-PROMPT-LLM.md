# How to Prompt LLM for Implementation

**Purpose**: Optimal prompting strategies to ensure complete, systematic, standards-compliant implementation without hallucination or code breaking.

---

## üéØ Core Prompting Principles

### 1. **Load Context First**
Always load the relevant plan file before asking for implementation.

### 2. **Request Verification Checks**
Ask LLM to verify against standards and test after each step.

### 3. **Demand Step-by-Step**
Never ask for "complete implementation" - break into sub-steps.

### 4. **Require Testing**
Always include testing verification in the prompt.

### 5. **Reference Exact Files**
Point to specific files and line numbers to prevent hallucination.

---

## üìù Prompt Templates

### Template 1: Starting a New Task

```
I'm implementing Task [NUMBER] from our auth security plan.

CONTEXT TO LOAD:
- Read: claudedocs/auth-security-plan/0[NUMBER]-TASK[N]-[NAME].md
- Read: claudedocs/auth-security-plan/01-OVERVIEW.md (CLAUDE.md standards section)

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Follow the plan EXACTLY as written - no deviations
2. Follow CLAUDE.md coding standards (check each requirement)
3. After EVERY step, provide a verification checklist
4. Show me the COMPLETE file content (not snippets)
5. Test each step before moving to next

VERIFICATION BEFORE STARTING:
- Confirm you've loaded both files
- List the sub-steps from the plan
- Confirm current file/database state

Let's start with Step [X.Y] only. Ready?
```

**Example**:
```
I'm implementing Task 1 (Forgot Password) from our auth security plan.

CONTEXT TO LOAD:
- Read: claudedocs/auth-security-plan/03-TASK1-FORGOT-PASSWORD.md
- Read: claudedocs/auth-security-plan/01-OVERVIEW.md (CLAUDE.md standards)

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Follow the plan EXACTLY - no deviations
2. Check CLAUDE.md standards: No hardcoding, Single source of truth, DRY, Type safety, Error handling
3. After EVERY step, provide verification checklist
4. Show COMPLETE file content (not snippets)
5. Test before moving to next step

VERIFICATION:
- Confirm files loaded
- List Steps 1.1 through 1.9

## üö´ Anti-Hallucination Strategies

### 1. **Always Reference Exact Files**

‚ùå **Bad Prompt**:
```
Implement the forgot password feature
```

‚úÖ **Good Prompt**:
```
Implement Step 1.2 from claudedocs/auth-security-plan/03-TASK1-FORGOT-PASSWORD.md
Show the COMPLETE file as written in the plan lines 50-150
```

---

### 2. **Request Complete Files, Not Snippets**

‚ùå **Bad Prompt**:
```
Add the forgot password function
```

‚úÖ **Good Prompt**:
```
Show the COMPLETE src/lib/auth/password-reset.ts file
Include ALL imports, ALL functions, ALL exports
No "... rest of code ..." placeholders
```

---

### 3. **Demand Verification Checklists**

‚ùå **Bad Prompt**:
```
Is this correct?
```

‚úÖ **Good Prompt**:
```
Verify this against the checklist:
- [ ] Follows plan Step 1.2 exactly
- [ ] Has PASSWORD_RESET_CONFIG constant
- [ ] All 3 functions: generate, verify, reset
- [ ] Error handling in each function
- [ ] Audit logging in reset function
- [ ] Exports config and types
Check each item and report status.
```

---

### 4. **Reference Current State**

‚ùå **Bad Prompt**:
```
Add CSRF protection
```

‚úÖ **Good Prompt**:
```
Current state: src/lib/security/csrf-protection.ts EXISTS
Current state: It's used in 1 route only

Task: Apply to ALL routes as per plan Step 2.3-2.6
List EXACT files to modify first, then do them one by one
```

---

### 5. **Ask for Diffs When Modifying**

‚ùå **Bad Prompt**:
```
Update the auth config file
```

‚úÖ **Good Prompt**:
```
Modify: src/lib/auth/config.ts
Show:
1. Current relevant section (lines to change)
2. New code to add
3. Complete updated function (not entire file)
4. Explanation of what changed

Format:
BEFORE (lines X-Y):
[code]

AFTER (lines X-Y):
[code]

CHANGES:
- Added: [what]
- Modified: [what]
- Reason: [why per plan]
```

## üéØ Key Success Factors

1. **Load Context Every Time**: Never rely on memory, always reload plan files
2. **One Sub-Step at a Time**: Never skip ahead or bundle steps
3. **Complete Files Only**: Never accept "... rest of code ..." responses
4. **Verify After Each Step**: Use checklists religiously
5. **Test Before Proceeding**: Never move forward with broken code
6. **Reference Plan Constantly**: Quote plan requirements in prompts
7. **Check CLAUDE.md Standards**: Every file, every time
8. **Commit Frequently**: After each working sub-step

---

## üìö Quick Reference

**Best Prompt Structure**:
```
1. Context: What I'm doing + load plan files
2. Current State: What exists now
3. Requirements: What plan says to do
4. Standards: CLAUDE.md checklist
5. Request: Specific action
6. Verification: How to check it's correct
7. Testing: How to test it works
```

**After Every LLM Response**:
- [ ] Matches plan requirements?
- [ ] Follows CLAUDE.md standards?
- [ ] Complete (not partial) file?
- [ ] Includes verification checklist?
- [ ] Provides test procedure?

**If LLM Hallucinating**:
- Stop immediately
- Reload plan file
- Quote exact requirements
- Ask for comparison: plan vs response
- Request correction with reference

---

**Last Updated**: January 2025

**Remember**: LLMs work best with:
- Clear, specific instructions
- Loaded context (plan files)
- Verification checklists
- One step at a time
- Complete outputs (no snippets)
