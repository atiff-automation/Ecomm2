# Authentication Security Implementation Plan

This directory contains a modular implementation plan for critical authentication security improvements.

## Quick Start

1. **Start Here**: [00-INDEX.md](./00-INDEX.md) - Complete navigation and overview
2. **Understand**: [01-OVERVIEW.md](./01-OVERVIEW.md) - Issues and solutions
3. **Prepare**: [02-PREREQUISITES.md](./02-PREREQUISITES.md) - Setup checklist
4. **Implement**: Follow task files 03-07 in sequence
5. **Test**: [08-TESTING-GUIDE.md](./08-TESTING-GUIDE.md)
6. **Deploy**: [09-DEPLOYMENT.md](./09-DEPLOYMENT.md)

## File Structure

```
00-INDEX.md              # Master index and navigation
01-OVERVIEW.md           # Issues, solutions, standards
02-PREREQUISITES.md      # Environment setup

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
03-TASK1-FORGOT-PASSWORD.md    # 4 hours
04-TASK2-CSRF-PROTECTION.md    # 3 hours  
05-TASK3-ADMIN-PASSWORD.md     # 2 hours

### Phase 2: Important (Week 2-3)
06-TASK4-FAILED-LOGIN-TRACKING.md  # 3 hours
07-TASK5-ADMIN-NOTIFICATIONS.md    # 2 hours

### Support
08-TESTING-GUIDE.md       # All test procedures
09-DEPLOYMENT.md          # Deploy and rollback
10-MAINTENANCE.md         # Ongoing tasks
11-TROUBLESHOOTING.md     # Common issues
12-REFERENCE.md           # Resources and metrics
```

## For LLMs/AI Assistants

When helping with implementation:
- Load the relevant task file for current work
- Reference 01-OVERVIEW.md for context and standards
- Check 11-TROUBLESHOOTING.md for common issues
- Verify against 08-TESTING-GUIDE.md

Each file is designed to be independently loadable within token limits.

## Total Effort

**Phase 1**: 8-10 hours (Critical)
**Phase 2**: 4-6 hours (Important)
**Total**: 12-16 hours focused development

## Status

- [ ] Phase 1: Task 1 (Forgot Password)
- [ ] Phase 1: Task 2 (CSRF Protection)
- [ ] Phase 1: Task 3 (Admin Password)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task 4 (Failed Login Tracking)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task 5 (Admin Notifications)
- [ ] Testing Complete
