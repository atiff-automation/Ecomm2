## Test Environment Setup

### Before Testing

**Prerequisites**:
- [ ] All code implementations complete
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Email service (Resend) working
- [ ] Development server running
- [ ] Test user accounts created

**Test Accounts Needed**:
```sql
-- Create test accounts (if not exist)
INSERT INTO users (email, password, role, firstName, lastName, status)
VALUES
  ('customer@test.com', '[hashed_password]', 'CUSTOMER', 'Test', 'Customer', 'ACTIVE'),
  ('admin@test.com', '[hashed_password]', 'ADMIN', 'Test', 'Admin', 'ACTIVE'),
  ('staff@test.com', '[hashed_password]', 'STAFF', 'Test', 'Staff', 'ACTIVE'),
  ('superadmin@test.com', '[hashed_password]', 'SUPERADMIN', 'Test', 'SuperAdmin', 'ACTIVE');
```

**Test Passwords**: Use `TestPass123!` for all test accounts (meets requirements)

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes Testing

### Test Suite 1: Forgot Password Flow

#### 1.1 Request Password Reset

**Test Case**: User can request password reset

    'x-csrf-token': 'fake-token-12345'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ test: 'data' })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
```
