## Issue #1: OrderStatus Enum Migration

**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES ATTENTION
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Database Migration

### Problem
Database schema update requires changing OrderStatus enum values:
- **Removing:** `CONFIRMED`, `PROCESSING`, `SHIPPED`
- **Adding:** `PAID`, `READY_TO_SHIP`, `IN_TRANSIT`, `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`

### Current State
- 1 order with status `CONFIRMED`
- 1 order with status `PENDING`

### Resolution Strategy
Before applying schema changes, migrate existing order statuses:
1. `CONFIRMED` → `PAID` (order is confirmed/paid, awaiting fulfillment)
2. `PROCESSING` → `READY_TO_SHIP` (if any exist)
3. `SHIPPED` → `IN_TRANSIT` (if any exist)

### Migration Script
Created: `scripts/migrate-order-statuses.ts`

### Action Taken
- Created pre-migration script to update statuses
- Will run before `prisma db push`
