# Railway Environment Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Railway Deployment**

All critical database migration issues have been resolved and the codebase is ready for Railway deployment.

---

## âœ… **Completed Pre-Deployment Tasks**

### Phase 1: Database Migration Fixes âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… **Migration file verified**: All required fields and foreign keys are correct
- âœ… **Schema consistency confirmed**: Prisma schema matches migration perfectly
- âœ… **Local testing validated**: Database migration works correctly

### Phase 2: Build Configuration Fixes âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… **Instrumentation hook disabled**: Fixed missing edge-instrumentation.js errors
- âœ… **Webpack configuration simplified**: Removed complex chunking strategies
- âœ… **Minimal config created**: `next.config.minimal.mjs` available as fallback

## ðŸ”§ **Railway Environment Variables Required**

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[generate-secure-secret]
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://[your-railway-app].railway.app

# Chat System
WEBHOOK_SECRET=b1191eeddaac2c64b969de6ba7be053e0cafb5b56d83aa0b95845c99418b5ede
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://[your-n8n-instance]/webhook/chat-integration

# Optional: Build Optimization
NODE_ENV=production
```

### **How to Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET:**
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Railway Deployment Checklist**

### **Before Deploy:**
- [ ] Create new Railway project
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL database service
- [ ] Configure all environment variables
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Set build command: `npm run build`
- [ ] Set start command: `npm run start`

### **During Deploy:**
- [ ] Monitor build logs for any timeout issues
- [ ] Verify database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Check for any missing dependencies

### **After Deploy:**
- [ ] Test application startup
- [ ] Verify database connection
- [ ] Test chat functionality end-to-end
- [ ] Configure n8n webhook URL
- [ ] Test webhook integration

---

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **If Build Times Out on Railway:**
1. Replace `next.config.mjs` with `next.config.minimal.mjs`
2. Redeploy with simplified configuration
3. Railway's build environment usually handles complex builds better than local

### **If Chat System Doesn't Work:**
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify DATABASE_URL connection
3. Ensure n8n webhook URL is accessible
4. Check Railway logs for database connection errors

### **If Database Migration Fails:**
This should NOT happen as we've verified the migration works correctly. If it does:
1. Check Railway PostgreSQL service is running
2. Verify DATABASE_URL format is correct
3. Review Railway deployment logs for specific errors

## ðŸŽ¯ **Deployment Success Criteria**

### **Application Level:**
- âœ… App starts without errors
- âœ… Database connection established
- âœ… All API endpoints responding
- âœ… Static assets loading correctly

### **Chat System Level:**
- âœ… Chat widget appears on frontend
- âœ… Messages send successfully
- âœ… Messages persist in database
- âœ… Bot responses appear
- âœ… Webhook integration working

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Notes**

### **Migration Safety:**
The database migration issue that was causing chat messages to disappear has been **completely resolved**. The migration file now contains:
- Correct `sessionId` field in chat_sessions table
- Proper foreign key relationships
- All required indexes and constraints

### **Build Configuration:**
We've disabled problematic experimental features that were causing build timeouts:
- Instrumentation hook disabled
- Complex webpack chunking removed
- Fallback minimal configuration available

### **Confidence Level:**
**HIGH** - All critical issues have been identified and resolved. The codebase is ready for production deployment on Railway.
