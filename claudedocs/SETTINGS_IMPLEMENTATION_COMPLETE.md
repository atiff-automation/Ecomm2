### Single Source of Truth
- Business profile eliminates redundancy across invoices/shipping
- Centralized tax configuration for all calculations
- Unified address management across customer/admin contexts
- Single audit logging system for all settings changes

### Role-Based Security
- **Customer** (`/settings/*`): Personal account management only
- **Admin** (`/admin/settings/*`): Business operations and configuration
- **Superadmin** (`/superadmin/settings/*`): Admin account control only
- Proper access control validation at API level

### Malaysian Compliance
- SSM registration format: `\d{6,8}-[A-Z]`
- GST number format: `[A-Z]\d{11}`
- Malaysian states validation with proper codes
- Postal code validation: `\d{5}`
- Phone number validation: `(\+?6?01)[02-46-9]\d{7,8}`

## 🔒 SECURITY FEATURES

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Banking data encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all setting changes
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions strictly enforced
- **Input Validation**: Server-side Zod validation for all inputs

### Compliance Ready
- GDPR-style data export/deletion
- Malaysian PDPA considerations
- Complete audit logging for compliance
- Secure password change workflows

## 🚀 PERFORMANCE FEATURES

### Caching Strategy
- Redis caching for business profile (1-hour TTL)
- Cache invalidation on profile updates
- Fallback to database when cache unavailable
- Distributed locking for cache consistency

### Optimized Queries
- Efficient Prisma queries with proper indexing
- Selective field loading for large datasets
- Batch operations where applicable
- Minimal N+1 query patterns
